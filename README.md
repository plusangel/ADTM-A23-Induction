# MSc in ADTM Programming Skills Workshop

Welcome to the induction week programming skills workshop. One of the programming languages that you are going to use is Python.
As it will be presented in the classroom, the task will be to build (very simple) an **airport simulation**.

Please create a new notebook for your work, and at the end of the workshop, download it to your desktop/laptop.
